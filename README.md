PCHao's RoR Blog Project


## This project has its main branch with the version of Server-side rendering website, while there's also a minor version in branch "Angular" implementing the website in angular.
However, due to the backend has been initially designed to be server-side render, it takes more time to change all the api into web-api design. Hence, the Angualr version has only the index page with RoR api response, and the rest pages were only pure SPA design without its backend api ready.
